[LTS]Ammunition - Extended Ammo

2024-03-29
    - IMPORTANT NOTICE -
     
      First I must apologise for any issues you may have had while using this mod.
      I had misunderstood the vanilla calculations and their base penetration property meaning.
      Thus I have readjusted all values for all projectiles so they better match vanilla and the weapons expected results.     
      
      So let me explain how this mod will work henceforth for calculations of Armor Piercing and HP rounds contra FMJ.
      Using my ammo mod now omit the game calculation for Armor penetration depending on Quality due to all bullets having pre set values.
      What does that mean?
      This means, Legendary and Masterwork weapons wont have increased ammo penetration nor will Awful weapons have a penalty.
      The damage bonus however still applies so HP projectiles will deal more damage but will have severely weakened armor penetration as was intended.
      Also note, the Armor piercing rounds will see a significant boost in penetration now and actually be viable in game.
      Stopping power have been adjusted as well. So AP, FMJ and HP simply have all their values set and will be very static.
      
      The guidelines I used for calculating values are as follows.
      
      AP rounds have double penetration, less damage and less stopping power.
      HP rounds have double stopping power, more damage and less penetration.
      FMJ have values that are equivalent to their vanilla counterparts.
      
      Overall, you'll find that this mod now actually works as was intended and I apologise once again for any and all inconveniences you may have had.
      
      Thank you Veritas â˜¨ and others who told me about this.
      
      If you have suggestions or any ideas to improve this further, don't hesitate to contact me.
      
      Now, the patch notes.
      
    - Readjusted ammo values.
    - Made most ammo require some manner of research to be crafted instead of just "Smithing". 
        - FMJ needs "Machining", AP and HP needs "Gunsmithing" as an example.
    - Added .357 Mag ammo for heavier revolvers
    - Added projectileWhenLoaded to all ammo thingdef for compatibility with Vehicle Framework and other mods.
    - Switched around 5.56, 7.62 and 338Lapua projectile images to better account for their actual size.
    - Fixed 7.62 and 5.56 names to the same as the textures.
    - To make up for a possible ammo shortage, various traders will have more types of ammo to sell.

    - Added some default association for ammo to some mods. Not all could get a good ammo fit atm, but am working on it.
    - Added weapon ammo association from Vanilla Weapons Expanded.
    - Added weapon ammo association from Vanilla Weapons Expanded Quickdraw.
    - Added weapon ammo association from Vanilla Weapons Expanded Frontier.
    - Added weapon ammo association from Vanilla Weapons Expanded Makeshift. (might not be perfect... Example: their shotgun now uses .22LR derp to not be crazy damage dealer due to their custom code)
    - Added Rimsenal Augmented Vanilla default assignment
    - Added Rimsenal spacer smart guns to auto assigned ammo.
    - Added Ammo to Rimsenal Spacer faction traders
